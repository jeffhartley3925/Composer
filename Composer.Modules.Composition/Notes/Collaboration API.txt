Collaborations.CurrentCollaborator: Set when a selection is made in the CollaborationPanel.

To switch to Inert Collaboration Objects:
	1. swap commenting on CollaborationMeasures property and BuildCollaborationMeasures method in MeasureViewModel.
	2. in code behind of CollaborationView replace MeasureViewModel with CollaborationMeasureViewModel or visa versa

Also, remeber, that Inert Collaboration Objects don't work yet. so, there is still work to do if you swtch to doing it that way.
