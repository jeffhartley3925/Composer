Measure clicks are caught by the OnClick handler in MeasureViewModel
    Is anything selected? If so, the click deselects all, and returns.
	Is the tool a note or rest? If so...
		Verify the note cam be placed in the measure.
			If it can be placed, then...
				ChordManager.AddNoteToChord()
					 Chord = GetOrCreate()
						1. if the cursor is over a existing chord, that chord is the target.
						2. otherwise, a new chord is created and it becomes the target.
							Create a new note and add it to the chord.
