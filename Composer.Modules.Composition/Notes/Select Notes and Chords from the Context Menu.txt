When the user right clicks a note, event handler NoteViewModel captures right mouse down event and sets EditorState.IsOverNote 
to true, and the Guid of the Note and its Chord are stored in NoteController.SelectedChordId and ChordManager.SelectedChordId 
respectively. 

The EditPopupMenu is shown. EditPopupMenuViewModel checks EditorState.IsOverNote and if true, 
the Select -> Note and Select -> Chord menu items are enabled. The user selects a menu item, and whatever work needs to be
done is done. When the user does something to cause the selection to be cleared, IsOverNote, NoteController.SelectedChordId 
and ChordManager.SelectedChordId are all set to null values for their type.
