The compositions ScrollViewer is in CompositionView. The CompositionView code behind grabs a reference to the ScrollViewer VerticalScrollBar
and creates an event handler (TrackOffset) for the scrollBar.ValueChanged event. When the event fires, TrackOffset broadcasts the UpdateScrollOffset event containing the horizontal
and vertical scroll offsets as the payload. CompositionManager subscribes to the UpdateScrollOffset event and sets the XScrollOffset and YScrollOffsets from the payload. 
Since CompositionManager is a static class the horizontal and vertical scroll offsets are now available throughout the application. CompoositionViewModel also subscribes to the
UpdateScrollOffset so that it can display the scroll offsets for debugging purposes.
