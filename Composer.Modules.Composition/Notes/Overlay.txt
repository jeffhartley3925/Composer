Overlays are no longer used, but functionality remains. 

Right now overlay is entertwined with note disposition, but can be severed with some thought.

To use Overlay:

1.	set the Prefernces.OverlayForeground property to something other than Transaprent.
2.	set Preferences.EnableOverlays to true;
3.	decouple the Disposition logic from the Overlay logic in the OnSetOverlay event handler in NoteViewModel.
	this decoupling may require some work on the Disposition logic located elsewhere.
4.	publish SetOverlay event as needed.
