the shell view is bootstrapped
the shell view loaded handler publishes LoginEvent
compositionviewmodel subscribes to LoginEvent and the handler makes the composition visible
compositionmodule subscribes to LoginEvent and the handler loads the hub region into the view
hubviewmodel calls the service to get all compositions associated with the user
the callback function does 1 of 2 things
	1. compositions are bound to the hub control. the hub control is shown and the user selects a composition.
	2. if there is a composition id in query string, then that composition is plucked out and displayed. the hub is hidden.
			the html5 hub sits on top of all this, and passes the id in thequery string



when no internet access
	set bFacebookDependenciesLoaded = true in index.js
	set EditorState.IsInternetAccess = false
